Assignment #2, microshell

Files in this project:
README
msh	 -- executable
msh.c    -- main c file
msh.h    -- header file
makefile

To compile this, simply type "make" within your terminal. Then to run type "make run". Lastly, to clean
the program and remove the executable file simply type "make clean".

This microshell can take in input in the format of "executableFile -argument" with any
number of other executable files piped after. The "exit" command is also built in.

This program taught us how executable files are run within unix shell.


We worked on the entire assignment together but the functions each member wrote are:
Awale: run(), runCommands(), main()
Said: prompt(), pipes()
